# Linear Regression Model in C

## File Structure

* simple.c -> runs simple linear regression on 2 variables
* multi.c -> runs multiple linear regression on >2 variables
* data.txt -> holds the data that we will run linear regression where each new line is a new point in the format of `x,y,z,...` (make sure no new line on the last line)

For plotting 3d points and plane generated, write code to do this in python -> save results to a csv and then have a python program that reads these in and executes generating the 3d plot.

For dimensions higher than 3 do not bother with the plotting.
